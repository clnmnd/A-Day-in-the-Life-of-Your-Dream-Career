	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>I start my day early, usually around 6:00 AM. 
			After getting dressed in my scrubs and grabbing a quick breakfast, I head to the hospital or clinic. 
			The morning begins with reviewing my schedule and patient charts. 
			I meet with patients who are pregnant, checking on their health and the baby’s development. 
			I listen to the baby’s heartbeat and answer any questions the mothers have. 
			Sometimes, I help women with other health concerns like menstrual issues or hormonal changes. 
			I find the mornings very rewarding because I get to support and care for women during important times in their lives.</p>

	    <section id="midday">
	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>By midday, I often perform prenatal ultrasounds or assist with deliveries if it's a busy day at the hospital. 
			I work closely with nurses, midwives, and other doctors to make sure everything goes smoothly. 
			I also see patients for annual exams and perform minor surgeries when needed. 
			There’s a lot of talking and explaining, making sure my patients understand their options and feel comfortable. 
			Paperwork and updating records take up part of my day, but that’s important to keep track of each patient’s care plan.</p>

	      <h2>Career Highlight Video</h2>
	      <p>This video shows something interesting about my dream job:</p>
	      
	      <!-- Option 1: Local video or video from free stock video sites -->
	      <!-- MAKE SURE TO CITE THE VIDEO PROPERLY 
	      <video controls width="400">
	        <source src="mycareer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	        Your browser does not support the video tag.
	      </video> -->

	      <!-- Option 2: YouTube video embed -->
	      <iframe width="400" height="250" 
	        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tH_Jriu7XkU" 
	        frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
	      </iframe>

	      <p>Here, it shows effective time division and management throughout the day, balancing clinical responsibilities with self-care and learning. 
			It highlights the fast-paced nature of being a doctor with varied tasks such as patient care, examinations, paperwork, and responding to calls, while also including breaks like meals, social interactions, short naps, and leisure activities like table tennis. 
			This mix reflects a realistic but manageable daily routine.
			While the video vividly shows the workload and challenges of a doctor's day, it does not deeply focus on how hard it is to become a doctor. 
			Instead, it emphasizes the daily effort required to maintain high standards of patient care and personal development. 
			The emphasis is on organization, teamwork, constant learning, and finding moments to recharge amid a busy schedule. 
			So, the video conveys both the demands and the importance of balance in a medical career but does not dwell heavily on the educational or training hardships leading to becoming a doctor.

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>One of my most unforgettable days was when I helped a woman through a difficult delivery. 
			She was having her first baby and was very nervous. 
			During labor, there were some complications, and I had to act quickly to make sure both mother and baby were safe. 
			After several intense hours, the baby was born healthy and strong. 
			The relief and joy in the mother’s eyes made all the hard work worth it. 
			Later, when she held her baby for the first time, I felt proud to be part of such a special moment in their lives. 
			It reminded me why I love being an OB-GYN — helping bring new life into the world and supporting women’s health.</p>
